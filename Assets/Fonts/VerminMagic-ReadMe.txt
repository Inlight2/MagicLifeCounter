VERMIN MAGIC
A TrueType Font by S. John Ross
Cumberland Games & Diversions

This hand-drawn font walks a drunken line between whimsical and sinister in some ways, with shaky little points and angles and a decidedly casual approach to its own baseline. The basic forms were inspired by a low-res pixel font from a videogame, with additional glyphs invented as necessary to round out a full keyboard set (plus a few of my usual extras). Owing mostly to its inspiration, it’s actually pretty legible despite it’s messiness, and it has the kind of jumbled warmth I like in my fonts. Enjoy!
